/**
 * At every point of time, page exposes its current frame tree via the {@link Page#mainFrame Page.mainFrame()} and {@link
 * Frame#childFrames Frame.childFrames()} methods.
 *
 * <p> {@code Frame} object's lifecycle is controlled by three events, dispatched on the page object:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link Page#onFrameAttached Page.onFrameAttached()} - fired when the frame gets attached to the page. A Frame can be
 * attached to the page only once.</li>
 * <li> {@link Page#onFrameNavigated Page.onFrameNavigated()} - fired when the frame commits navigation to a different URL.</li>
 * <li> {@link Page#onFrameDetached Page.onFrameDetached()} - fired when the frame gets detached from the page.  A Frame can be
 * detached from the page only once.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> An example of dumping frame tree:
 * <pre>{@code
 * import com.microsoft.playwright.*;
 *
 * public class Example {
 *   public static void main(String[] args) {
 *     try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
 *       BrowserType firefox = playwright.firefox();
 *       Browser browser = firefox.launch();
 *       Page page = browser.newPage();
 *       page.navigate("https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html");
 *       dumpFrameTree(page.mainFrame(), "");
 *       browser.close();
 *     }
 *   }
 *   static void dumpFrameTree(Frame frame, String indent) {

 *     for (Frame child : frame.childFrames()) {
